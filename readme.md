# GSAP Learning and Projects

This repository serves as a showcase for learning and experimenting with GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform). It includes various projects that demonstrate the capabilities and features of GSAP for creating dynamic and interactive animations.

## About GSAP

GSAP, or the GreenSock Animation Platform, is a powerful JavaScript library for creating high-performance animations. It provides a robust set of tools and features that enable developers to animate virtually any DOM element with ease. Some key features of GSAP include:

- **Tweening**: Smoothly transition between CSS properties.
- **Timeline**: Control and orchestrate sequences of animations.
- **Plugins**: Extend GSAP with additional capabilities like scrolling animations, physics-based motion, and more.
- **Easing**: Apply various easing functions to customize animation transitions.

## Projects

### Timeline Animation

**Description**: This project demonstrates a timeline-based animation where clicking on a menu icon slides in a full-screen menu with animated text and icons.

- **Features**:
  - Interactive menu animation triggered by clicking an icon (`#nav i`).
  - Smooth transitions managed through GSAP's timeline (`tl`).
  - Responsive design for seamless user experience across devices.

### Cursor Image

**Description**: This project showcases a webpage where the cursor dynamically follows the user's mouse movements and triggers interactive animations on hovering over an image.

- **Features**:
  - Custom cursor (`#cursor`) implemented using GSAP to follow mouse movements.
  - Image overlay effect on hover with scaled cursor interaction.
  - Utilizes GSAP for animation handling and responsiveness.

## Learning GSAP

This repository also serves as a learning resource for GSAP enthusiasts, providing:

- **Code Examples**: Explore practical implementations of GSAP animations.
- **Documentation Links**: References to official GSAP documentation for detailed learning.
- **Experimentation**: Encourages experimentation and modification of existing projects to deepen understanding.

## Usage

To explore and run the projects locally:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Open the desired project's `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**: Foundations for creating web animations and interactions.
- **GSAP**: Primary library for implementing advanced animations and effects.
