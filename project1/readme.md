# Cursor Image Project

This project showcases a dynamic cursor effect combined with interactive animations using GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform).

## Description

The HTML (`index.html`), CSS (`style.css`), and JavaScript (`script.js`) files collectively create a visually engaging webpage featuring:

- A responsive layout with a centered image (`#image`) and overlay effects.
- Custom cursor (`#cursor`) that dynamically follows the user's mouse movements.
- GSAP animations for smooth transitions and interactive elements.

## Features

- **Dynamic Cursor**: The cursor (`#cursor`) moves with the user's mouse, offering a visual enhancement.
- **Interactive Overlay**: Hover effects on the image (`#image`) trigger overlays for additional visual feedback.
- **Responsive Design**: The webpage adjusts seamlessly to different screen sizes.
